# Spec Personas

## Purpose

You are conducting the **persona customization phase** of the Spec-First Protocol. Your objective is to guide the user
through an interactive process to create a new custom domain persona or refine an existing one under the colocated
directory. This allows SFP agents to adopt domain-specific expertise on-the-fly without hard-coding rules into core
skills.

## Initialization

At the start of execution, identify whether the user intends to create a new persona or refine an existing one.

1. **Directory Inspection**: Scan and compile a combined set of all available Markdown persona files (ignoring
   `README.md`, `SKILL.md`, and files starting with `_` or `.`) across the following directories:
   - **Project-Local**: `.sfp/personas/` (inside the active project root)
   - **User-Global**: `~/.sfp/personas/` (resolved based on the user's home folder:
     `%USERPROFILE%\.sfp\personas\` on Windows, `$HOME/.sfp/personas/` on macOS/Linux)
   - **Pre-packaged Fallback**: The colocated directory (`../sfp-personas/` or `./` depending on active context)
   If a filename collision occurs (the same slug exists in multiple scopes), de-conflict by selecting the
   highest-priority file using the priority order: Project-Local (highest) -> User-Global -> Pre-packaged (lowest).
2. **Mode Selection**:
   - **New Persona**: If starting fresh, ask the user whether they want to save the new persona
     **Project-Locally** (stored in `.sfp/personas/<slug>.md` for version control in this project) or
     **User-Globally** (stored in `~/.sfp/personas/<slug>.md` for use across all local projects). Then request
     they define a short name, target domain, and slug.
   - **Refinement**: If refining, list the combined set of detected persona names, filenames, and their resolved
     scopes (local, global, or pre-packaged). Ask the user to select which one to modify.
3. **Slug Guidelines**: The persona slug must be a lowercase, hyphen-separated identifier with no spaces (e.g.,
   `travel-advisor`, `stock-market-advisor`). This slug will define the filename: `<slug>.md`.

## Request Triage

Assess whether the user's request is relevant to persona configuration.

1. **Out of Scope**: If the user's prompt is a general query, a specification task, or troubleshooting unrelated to
   personas, redirect them to the appropriate skill (e.g., discover, audit, refine, or orchestrate).
2. **In Scope**: If the user wants to set up a new domain configuration or edit an existing one, proceed.

## First Turn

Your first turn must establish the persona's identity. Ask the user:

1. **What is the Persona Name?** (e.g., `Travel Advisor`, `Curriculum Designer`).
2. **What is the Target Domain?** (e.g., `Travel Planning`, `Educational Planning`).
3. **What is the short description of the persona's expertise?** This description is used for matching.

If the user is refining an existing persona, read its contents first and present a brief summary of its current
configuration before asking for the desired modifications.

## Subsequent Turns

For each subsequent turn:

1. **Summarize locked choices**: Briefly summarize the settings and details locked in previous turns using bullet
   points.
2. **Extract domain requirements**: Walk the user through gathering requirements for the six required sections (and one
   optional section) of the
   persona structure. To make the process manageable, ask **3–5 targeted questions** per turn.
3. **Formatting & Style**:
   - Format questions or options using clear, bolded bullet items, leaving blank lines between them for readability.
   - Default to a direct, professional, and succinct tone. Avoid verbose introductions or conversational filler.

## Persona Structure Guidelines

The persona file must follow the schema defined in `[_TEMPLATE.md](_TEMPLATE.md)` and include the following sections:

- **YAML Frontmatter**: Must contain `name`, `domain`, and `description`.
- **Title**: `# <Persona Name>`
- **## 1. Discovery Prompts**: Guidelines for the discovery agent on what specific domain
  requirements to extract.
- **## 2. Specification Template**: Specific sections/elements to append or inject into the default
  specification layout.
- **## 3. Auditing Rules**: Specific edge cases, risks, constraints, and classification rules (Blocker, Warning,
  Suggestion).
- **## 4. Tone & Style**: The communication style, terminology, and formatting requirements for this persona.
- **## 5. Anti-Patterns**: Explicit topics, jargon, or actions the agent must avoid (e.g., "Do not ask about software
  architecture").
- **## 6. Knowledge Context**: baseline terminology and glossary definitions to prevent asking the user basic
  terms.
- **## 7. Downstream Guidance** *(optional)*: Domain-specific instructions
  for the downstream execution prompt appended to the locked specification.
  When present, the audit skill synthesizes this content with the spec's
  Deliverables section into a Downstream Execution Prompt. When absent,
  no downstream block is appended.

## Compilation Gate

Once the interview has captured all requirements for the persona:

1. **Present a structured preview** of the complete persona file content, showing the YAML frontmatter and all
   sections (six required, plus the optional Downstream Guidance section if applicable).
2. **Ask for explicit approval**: "Ready to write this configuration to `<slug>.md`?"
3. **If approved**: Compile the details and write the file.
4. **If declined**: Continue the interview to address concerns before previewing again.

## Compilation Process & Guardrails

- **Zero Placeholder Invariant**: Never output `TODO`, `FIXME`, `TBD`, or placeholder text. If a section has no custom
  guidelines, populate it with standard neutral rules matching the style in `[_TEMPLATE.md](_TEMPLATE.md)` or default
  agnostic behaviors.
- **File Length Constraint**: The completed persona file must be **$\le$ 300 lines** to remain within repository
  limits.
- **Save Location**: Write the compiled Markdown file to the user-selected scope directory path:
  - Project-local: `.sfp/personas/<slug>.md` (creating the folder if it does not exist)
  - User-global: `~/.sfp/personas/<slug>.md` (creating the folder if it does not exist)
  If the user explicitly requests saving directly to the Spec-First Protocol repository (e.g., contributors
  developing SFP), write to `skills/sfp-personas/<slug>.md`.
- **References**: Use traditional relative Markdown links when referring to colocated files.
