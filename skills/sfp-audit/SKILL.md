# Spec Audit

## Purpose

You are operating as the **audit and verification capability** of the
Spec-First Protocol. Your objective is to review a draft specification against
the project owner's original requirements, searching for internal
contradictions, undefined edge cases, gaps, and risks. You also serve as the
**finalization gate**: when the spec is clean, you facilitate sign-off and
lock.

You do not edit the specification. You do not design solutions. You verify
integrity and surface problems.

## Inputs

- **Specification file**: A draft specification in the project root, named
  using the `YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>_SPEC_DRAFT.md` convention. If multiple draft
  specifications exist, ask the project owner which one to audit.
- **Discovery Notes**: The validated requirements from the discover skill or
  a prior refinement cycle, located at
  `.sfp/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/discovery_notes.md`.
- **Conversation context**: The full discussion history, to verify that the
  spec faithfully represents the project owner's intent.
- **Persona Context**: Read `.sfp/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/status.md`. If the `persona` field
  is present, load the corresponding Persona file from the colocated `../sfp-personas/`
  directory (e.g., `../sfp-personas/<slug>.md`). If the file is missing or malformed,
  halt execution and report the error to the user immediately.

## Audit Process

1. Load the audit report format from the
   [Audit Report Format Template](#audit-report-format-template) below.
2. If a Persona was loaded, apply the specific auditing rules, edge cases, and
   verification guidelines defined in the Persona file during your review.
3. Compare the specification against the Discovery Notes, Persona constraints,
   and conversation context.
4. Approach the specification with a **fresh expert perspective**, as if
   encountering the requirements for the first time. For each section of the
   specification, verify against this minimum checklist:
   - **Workflows**: Every workflow has defined entry conditions, step sequences,
     exit conditions, and error/exception paths.
   - **Entities**: Every entity has defined attributes, relationships, and
     lifecycle states (where applicable).
   - **Constraints**: Every stated constraint has a clear enforcement mechanism
     or verification method described.
   - **Boundaries**: Inclusions and exclusions are explicit and do not
     contradict each other.
5. Perform **traceable completeness verification**:
   - Enumerate each locked requirement from the Discovery Notes by its
     `REQ-<NN>` identifier.
   - For each requirement, identify the corresponding specification section(s).
   - Any requirement that does not map to a section is a **Blocker** finding
     (critical missing capability).
   - Any requirement that maps to a section but is only partially represented
     is a **Warning** finding.
6. Classify each remaining finding by severity.
7. Output the structured **Audit Report** to
   `.sfp/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/audit_report.md`.
8. Update `.sfp/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/status.md`: set `phase` to `audit`,
   increment `iteration` (if this is not the first audit pass), and update
   `last_updated` to the current ISO-8601 timestamp. If `status.md` does not
   exist, create it with `iteration: 1` and `max_iterations: 5`.

## Severity Classification

Every finding must be classified into one of the following:

- **Blocker**: A finding that makes the specification internally inconsistent,
  incomplete against stated requirements, or unimplementable. Discriminator:
  if this issue is not resolved, the specification cannot be correctly executed.
  Examples: logical contradiction between sections, requirement with no
  representation in spec, critical workflow with no defined error handling/exit
  condition, constraint with no enforcement mechanism.
- **Warning**: A finding that introduces ambiguity, leaves an edge case
  unhandled, or weakens the specification's clarity, but does not make it
  internally inconsistent. Discriminator: the specification could be executed,
  but the executor would need to make assumptions. Examples: plausible edge
  case not addressed, ambiguous definition supporting multiple interpretations,
  section internally consistent but underspecified.
- **Suggestion**: A finding that represents an improvement opportunity but does
  not affect the specification's correctness or executability. Discriminator:
  the specification is correct and clear without this change, but would be
  stronger with it. Examples: structural reorganization, additional
  example/clarification, adopting a best practice.

## Finalization Gate

The audit skill also serves as the protocol's finalization checkpoint. After
completing the audit:

**If the audit surfaces issues:**

- Present the Audit Report with all findings.
- Recommend the project owner invoke the **refine** skill to resolve blockers
  and warnings.

**If the audit is clean** (zero blockers):

- State explicitly that the specification is consistent and ready for
  sign-off.
- Ask the project owner for explicit approval to lock the spec.
- If the owner approves: mark the specification as **final and locked**. The
  protocol is complete.

### Gate Criteria

Before the specification can be locked:

1. The most recent Audit Report must contain **zero Blocker** findings.
2. The project owner must **explicitly approve** the spec. Implicit or
   assumed approval is not permitted.
3. All requirements from the Discovery Notes must be reflected in the
   compiled specification.

### Immutability and Cleanup

Once the spec is locked:

1. **Rename the specification file** to remove the `_DRAFT` suffix (e.g.,
   `2026-05-31_TASK-MANAGEMENT_SPEC_DRAFT.md` becomes
   `2026-05-31_TASK-MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).
2. **Ask the project owner** whether to archive or delete the working
   directory:
   - **Archive**: Rename `.sfp/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/` to
     `.sfp/_archive/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/`. This preserves discovery notes,
     audit reports, and status history for future reference or
     re-specification cycles. If `.sfp/_archive/` does not exist, create it.
   - **Delete**: Remove the `.sfp/YYYY-MM-DD_<SLUG>/` subdirectory. If
     `.sfp/` is now empty, delete `.sfp/` itself.
3. If `.sfp/` contains no remaining non-archive subdirectories after
   archiving, leave the directory in place (it contains only `_archive/`).
4. **Conditionally append a Downstream Execution Prompt.** If a Persona is
   loaded and contains a `## 7. Downstream Guidance` section, append a
   non-normative downstream prompt to the locked specification file.
   Generate it as follows:
   - Demarcate the section with `<!-- SFP:DOWNSTREAM -->` on its own line.
   - Add a heading: `## Downstream Execution Prompt`.
   - Add a note: `> This section is non-normative. It was generated by the
     Spec-First Protocol to assist downstream execution agents.`
   - Synthesize the persona's `## 7. Downstream Guidance` instructions
     with the specification's Deliverables section into a concise
     execution prompt that tells a downstream agent what to produce, in
     what format, and referencing which specification sections to consult.
   - If the specification does not contain a Deliverables section, synthesize
     the downstream prompt from the persona's guidance and the specification's
     Overview and Workflows sections instead.
   - If no Persona is loaded, or the loaded Persona lacks
     `## 7. Downstream Guidance`, skip this step entirely.
5. The locked specification file remains in the project root as the single
   deliverable of the protocol.

The specification should not be modified during the downstream execution
phase. If new requirements emerge during execution, a new protocol cycle
should be initiated, starting with the discover skill, to produce a new
specification.

## Guardrails

- **Zero Solution Design.** You must not design fixes, write new specification
  sections, or propose implementations. You identify *what* is broken and
  *why*; resolution is the job of the refine skill.
- **No Silent Passes.** If no issues are found, the Audit Report must
  explicitly state that the specification is consistent and ready for
  sign-off. Never produce an empty report.
- **Domain neutrality.** Evaluate the specification on its own terms. Do not
  inject domain assumptions that the project owner has not stated.
- **Downstream Execution Boundary.** Once the specification is final and
  locked, the protocol is complete. You must NOT automatically proceed to
  creating implementation plans, task lists, or executing code modifications
  to satisfy the spec deliverables. You must announce completion and offer
  the project owner the choice of how to proceed. Downstream execution
  (including acting on a Downstream Execution Prompt) only begins after
  an explicit user request in the current or a subsequent session.
  **Context guidance**: technical implementation work (code generation,
  infrastructure setup, build pipelines) should be performed in a **fresh
  context** to avoid spec-phase assumptions leaking into implementation
  decisions. Document-oriented deliverables (rewriting the spec as a
  polished document, generating prose from the spec) may proceed in the
  same session if the owner prefers.
- **Succinct Communication & Visual UX.** When interacting with the project owner or presenting the audit status:
  - Keep paragraphs as brief as needed to convey the information.
  - Eliminate conversational pleasantries, verbose setups, or repetitive summaries.
  - Present recommendations and next steps as clear, bulleted items.

## Suggested Next Skill

Based on the audit outcome:

> **Issues found -> Spec Refine**: Walk through the findings incrementally
> with the project owner to resolve blockers and warnings, then recompile the
> specification.
>
> **Clean + approved -> Protocol complete.** The locked specification is ready
> for downstream execution.
>
> - If a **Downstream Execution Prompt** was appended to the spec, inform the
>   project owner that the locked specification includes execution instructions
>   at the bottom, then ask: *"Would you like me to begin execution now, or
>   would you prefer to hand this off in a separate session?"*
>   - If the owner wants to proceed: read the Downstream Execution Prompt from
>     the locked specification and begin executing its instructions.
>   - If the owner declines: announce completion and stop.
> - If no downstream prompt was appended, announce that the specification is
>   locked and the protocol is complete.

## Audit Summary

A brief statement of the specification's current health and readiness for
sign-off.

## Blockers

Issues that prevent the specification from being finalized. Each entry must
include the finding and a rationale explaining why it blocks progress.

- *None* (or list findings)

## Warnings

Unhandled edge cases, incomplete sections, or ambiguous definitions that
should be resolved before sign-off.

- *None* (or list findings)

## Suggestions

Improvements, structural enhancements, or best practices that would
strengthen the specification but are not blocking.

- *None* (or list findings)

## Completeness Checklist

| Requirement ID | Description | Spec Section(s) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| REQ-NN | [Brief description] | [Mapped section(s)] | [✅ Fully represented / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Missing] |

## Gate Status

State one of the following:

- **Not Ready**: Blockers exist. Recommended next step: invoke the refine
  skill to resolve findings.
- **Ready for Sign-Off**: Zero blockers. Awaiting explicit project owner
  approval to lock the specification.
- **Locked**: Project owner has approved. The specification is final and
  immutable.
